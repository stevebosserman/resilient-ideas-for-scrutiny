# Time-Based Economy Notes

## Summary Points
All time in this world is consumed with interactions: self; natural environment; people; manmade things; and, unseen and unknown

Those interactions are spread among the five levels of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) [1]

One distributes time daily between sleep and wakefulness; public and private activities; and meeting Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs 

While one can exist by oneself, it is easier to meet basic needs when interacting with others who have common goals

These interactions are coordinated exchanges that enable individuals to have more time available to do what they want rather than what they must

The source of power which spawns and sustains any social system (coordinated exchanges) is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

The power structure that emerges within a social system determines the conditions by which members of that system can meet their basic needs and pursue higher level needs of Maslow's Hierarchy
 
An ethical framework consisting of the principles and values germane to a particular social system guides its members in the design and use of the power structure.

Social system governance mandates policy that converts into legal parameters to assure the power structure conforms to the ethical framework and influences the behaviors of system members
