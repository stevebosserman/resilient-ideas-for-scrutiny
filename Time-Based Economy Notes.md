# Time-Based Economy Notes

## Introduction
### Questions to Frame Chapters (first cut):
* How do we spend our time?
* What value does our effort have in making us more complete and fulfilled human beings?
* How would we spend our time if we didn't have to spend it meeting our basic needs?
	* How important is that alternative, really? 
* Would we be willing to create a system that enabled people to meet their basic needs without having to spend their time to do so?
* Would we be willing to create such a system if we did not benefit directly from it, but made it available (paid it forward) for our children, grandchildren, etc.?  

### Further input to first cut:
I would add however that there is another part of human nature that promotes greed, thereby the necessary need to accumulate beyond that of their neighbors.  This is partially what led to the concept of a monetary system in the first place because this scenario created the ability to go beyond the set boundaries of a 24-hour clock and enable a system of accumulation for which individuals, groups or governments could multiply their wealth or inventory. Time has an innate restraint on accumulation and therefore limits those that want a system that allows them to have more of something than others in order to satisfy their greed and/or need to feel or be superior and excise power.  If society could figure out a way to eliminate this human failing than perhaps time alone would work.

### Themes to Consider in Framing Chapters (second cut)
## Part One: Time and the Individual
### Theme One: 
All time in this world is consumed with interactions: self; natural environment; people; manmade things; and unseen and unknown

### Theme Two: 
Those interactions are spread among the five original and three extended (cognitive, aesthetic, and transcendence) levels of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html) [1]

## Part Two: The Individual and the Community
### Theme Four: 
While one can exist by oneself, it is easier to meet basic needs when interacting with others who have common goals

### Theme Five: 
These interactions are coordinated exchanges that enable individuals to have more time available to do what they want rather than what they must

## Part Three: The Community and Power
### Theme Six: 
The source of power which spawns and sustains any social system (coordinated exchanges) is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

### Theme Seven: 
The power structure that emerges within a social system determines the conditions by which members of that system can meet their basic needs and pursue higher level needs of Maslow's Hierarchy

### Theme Eight: 
An ethical framework consisting of the principles and values germane to a particular social system guides its members in the design and use of the power structure.

### Theme Nine: 
Social system governance mandates policy that converts into legal parameters to assure the power structure conforms to the ethical framework and influences the behaviors of system members
