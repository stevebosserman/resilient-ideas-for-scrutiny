##Steve Bosserman's Response:
In consideration of your request, I would offer that historians will look back on 2016 as the year when the forces of change aligned to begin the world's final drive into a post-capitalist reality. Each of us have our preferred evaluative methods to note this occasion. My primary indicators concerned the ongoing and pervasive presence of certain human behaviors which I considered essential to precipitate such an onslaught:

1. Commitment by individuals and groups to systems, processes, and tools that enable people to meet their basic needs where they are so they do not resort to destroying the environment, emigrating / seeking refuge elsewhere, or resorting to radicalism or nihilism
2. Adoption of acknowledgement systems that assume each person has value to offer regardless of circumstances and recognize those occasions when each person contributes the value they have
3. Match of distributed governance structures to population centers (nodes) so that residents have the authority to localize their knowledge commons, manage their resource flows (sources to sinks), and ultimately, meet their basic needs
4. Connections of distributed population centers (nodes) into regional and global economic networks wherein residents can exchange ideas, share experiences, refresh their knowledge commons, and restore the sources of their localized resource flows

The political, diplomatic, economic, societal, and environmental events of 2016 have provided the catalyst to launch what's next in an irreversible and inevitable way. While the list of Top Ten Trends for 2016 you've compiled thus far and will no doubt rigorously refine, is excellent, I submit there's a larger contextual drama playing out that the composite listing does not fully address. And that is that 2016 represents the year when the world turned the corner on its future and from here on out we're building what's next more than we're perpetuating what is or what was.
