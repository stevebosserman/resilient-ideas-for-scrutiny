#Why Is 2016 a Pivotal Year?
##[Question by Michel Bauwens on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mbauwens/posts/10157920009745548?comment_id=10157920320210548&reply_comment_id=10157921541395548&ref=notif&notif_t=mentions_comment&notif_id=1483515899693486&hc_location=ufi)

>Dear Steve Bosserman,

>What makes you say that 2016 has been a pivot year in this ... I had the impression that 2015 was one, and most of these trends have perhaps consolidated in 2016, (see our top trends of 2015), but this year, what makes you conclude it was a pivot?

##Steve Bosserman's Response

Michel: Thanks for the question! Bear in mind that being in the US throughout 2016 influences my perspective.  With that caveat in mind and having reread [The Top Ten P2P Trends of 2015](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/top-ten-p2p-trends-of-2015/2016/01/06) I can place the key determinants under a general heading of _the only ones we can truly trust are those in the communities where we reside_.  Previously, we held out hope that the established decision-making processes at international, federal, and state levels would yield results we could live with and we would not have to change in substantive ways (read: actively adopt and proliferate the strategies identified in last year's "P2P top ten").  

Here are four of the major conditions I found that make 2016 "pivotal" (in the sense of a pendulum ending its arc in one direction and starting its return):

1. A significant number of people are not "feeling the love" of globalization wedded with [neoliberalism](http://www.e-ir.info/2015/03/21/what-is-neoliberalism-and-how-does-it-relate-to-globalization/ "What Is 'Neoliberalism', and How Does It Relate to Globalization?") - to the point where they rejected this union in the US and Great Britain.
2. The rise of [fake news](http://undark.org/article/fake-news-post-truth-cognition-brain/ "The Problem of the Lazy Brain") has called into question the integrity of established media outlets and news services - how do we really know what's going on and understand its significance?
3. Flirtation with (if not the embrace of) [fascism](https://ratical.org/ratville/CAH/fasci14chars.html "The 14 Characteristics of Fascism by Lawrence Britt, Ree Inquiry Magazine, Spring 2003") - demonstrated most notably by the demonization of those deemed to be "outsiders" or "different".
4. [Opioid addiction](http://www.asam.org/docs/default-source/advocacy/opioid-addiction-disease-facts-figures.pdf "American Society of Addiction Medicine Opioid Addiction 2016 Facts & Figures"), which devastates families and impacts communities throughout the US - and only gets worse despite all-out efforts to criminalize addicts and users as a deterrent.

The consequence of these four (and many more that readers are encouraged to add!) is that WE NOW KNOW "the establishment" / "the dominant culture" / "the system" is hopelessly corrupt, anachronistic, and cares not a whit for the majority of those it's in place "to protect and serve".  That realization of systemic failure to such a degree tipped the scales in 2016. 

For example, within my community, I KNOW who's struggling to make ends meet and who's not even able to do that; I KNOW what's reality and what's fiction; I KNOW good people who belong to those classifications judged to be unworthy of residence in the US; I KNOW individuals and families who have to deal with issues of addiction and death and they deserve respect, care and compassion, NOT to be treated as pariah.  Armed with this GROUND TRUTH I can tap into the P2P top-ten trends for 2015 (and 2016) with UNWAVERING COMMITMENT and join with individuals and groups where I reside to build what's next starting at the community level. 

It is this across the board realization that we have no alternative thereby profoundly altering our behaviors that earmarks 2016 as a pivotal year and sends the pendulum back to the future of our community roots.
